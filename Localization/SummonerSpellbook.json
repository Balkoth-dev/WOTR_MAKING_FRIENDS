    "enGB": "At 1st level, a summoner can cast summon monster I as a spell a number of times per day equal to 3 + his Charisma modifier. He can cast this spell as a standard action, and the creatures remain for 1 minute per level (instead of 1 round per level). At 3rd level, and every 2 levels thereafter, the power of this ability increases by 1 spell level, allowing him to summon more powerful creatures (to a maximum of summon monster IX at 17th level)."
