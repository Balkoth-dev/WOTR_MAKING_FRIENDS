## Change Log
```

```

## Known Issues
```
* Eidolons do not qualify for all weapon focus feats.
* If a character has more than 2 companions (such as an Eidolon+Aivu+Animal Companion), the UI breaks.
* If a party has more than 13 units in total, the game breaks.
* Attack animations won't play for certain body-types. This is because they don't have an animation for that attack, but the attack will still happen.
* Sometimes even if your Eidolon has arms the game will lock the equipment slots, reloading your game fixes this issue.
* Bonded Senses doesn't refresh when the eidolon changes their perception ranks, reloading your game fixes this issue.
